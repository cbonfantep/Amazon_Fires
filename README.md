Problem Statement for Brazil Fires:

There has been an explosion of international media attention regarding a supposed relative spike in the number of forest fires experienced during the months of July and August  2019 in the Brazilian Amazon.

We propose, in our team project “Brazilian Fires in the Amazon” to search for and analyze reliable, available public data regarding Brazilian forest fires in the Amazon, in order to substantiate or refute the above-referenced premise.

In other words: Does environmental data show clear evidence that the frequency of fires within the Brazilian Amazon forests has dramatically increased over the past several years, relative to the fire frequency over the last decade?
